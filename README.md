# .Net_Clean_architecture
Backend Code Demo

Key Features:

Separation of Concerns: The codebase clearly separates business logic, application core, and presentation layers, following the principles of Clean Architecture. This separation allows for independent development and testing of each component.

Dependency Injection: Utilizing the built-in dependency injection framework, this demo illustrates how to manage and inject dependencies efficiently, promoting loose coupling and making the codebase more flexible.

Entity Framework and ORM: The project demonstrates the integration of Entity Framework or another ORM of your choice to interact with the database. It showcases how to manage data persistence while keeping database-related code isolated from the rest of the application.

API Endpoints: The backend provides RESTful API endpoints using ASP.NET Web API, enabling seamless communication with frontend or external services. It includes endpoints for CRUD operations, authentication, and authorization.

Unit Testing: The codebase includes a comprehensive suite of unit tests that verify the correctness of the application's behavior, ensuring robustness and maintainability.

Logging and Exception Handling: The demo incorporates logging and exception handling strategies to track application activities and handle errors gracefully, enhancing reliability and supportability.

Scalability and Performance: Designed with scalability in mind, the architecture allows for easy scaling by adding new modules or microservices. Performance considerations are included in various aspects of the application.

Documentation: Detailed documentation explains the project's structure, how to set it up, and how to extend or modify its features, making it accessible for developers of varying skill levels.
