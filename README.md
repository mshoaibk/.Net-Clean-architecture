# .NET Clean Architecture Backend Code Demo

## Key Features

- **Separation of Concerns**: This project follows the Clean Architecture principles, clearly separating business logic, application core, and presentation layers. This separation allows for independent development and testing of each component.

- **Dependency Injection**: We efficiently manage and inject dependencies using the built-in dependency injection framework, promoting loose coupling and making the codebase more flexible.

- **Entity Framework and ORM**: Our project demonstrates the integration of Entity Framework or another ORM of your choice to interact with the database. We showcase how to manage data persistence while keeping database-related code isolated from the rest of the application.

- **API Endpoints**: The backend provides RESTful API endpoints using ASP.NET Web API, enabling seamless communication with frontend or external services. It includes endpoints for CRUD operations, authentication, and authorization.

- **Unit Testing**: Our codebase includes a comprehensive suite of unit tests that verify the correctness of the application's behavior, ensuring robustness and maintainability.

- **Logging and Exception Handling**: Our project incorporates robust logging and sophisticated exception handling strategies using the "Serilog" library to meticulously track application activities and gracefully manage errors. This enhances the overall reliability and supportability of the application, making it more resilient and easier to maintain.

- **Scalability and Performance**: Designed with scalability in mind, the architecture allows for easy scaling by adding new modules or microservices. Performance considerations are included in various aspects of the application.

- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation explains the project's structure, how to set it up, and how to extend or modify its features, making it accessible for developers of varying skill levels.

## Module Descriptions

- **HRM_Application**: Contains application-specific business logic and use cases, serving as an intermediary between the presentation layer and the core/domain layer to implement application-specific rules.

- **HRM_Common**: Holds code and components shared across different parts of the application, including utility functions, constants, or shared resources.

- **HRM_Core_WebApp**: Represents the core of the web application, handling web-specific components like controllers, views, and routing. This layer is responsible for HTTP request and response handling.

- **HRM_Domain**: Contains core business logic and domain models, free from specific technology or framework, representing pure business rules and entities.

- **HRM_Infrastructure**: Manages technical infrastructure aspects, including data access, external services, and persistence. It provides implementations for data repositories, database integration, and other infrastructure concerns.

- **HRM_Presentation**: Responsible for the presentation layer, including user interfaces and user interaction. It connects to the application layer (HRM_Application) and translates user actions into application operations.

Clean Architecture encourages this separation to create a maintainable, testable, and adaptable software application. It enables different parts of the application to evolve independently without tight coupling.
